# Frontend Mentor - NFT preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS organization
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've learned how to apply an invisible layer to an imagine capable of displaying it with hover.

```html
<h1>I am proud of the optimization I was able to do while coding, this time. Dimishing the lines of my work.</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
main section .first-part .hover .view {
  position: absolute;
  width: 50px;
  cursor: pointer;
  opacity: 0;
}
main section .first-part .hover span:hover + .view {
  opacity: 1;
}
